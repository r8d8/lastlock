 * @{
 * The OTP_TLV module supports Tag/Length/Value storage within one-time programmable memory.
 *
 * This module allows writes, typically manufacturing, of TLVs to OTP
 * and run-time retrieval of TLV value by tag. TLVs are stored sequentially
 * in the order in which they are written, from low to high offsets within a
 * designated area of OTP. A given tag should appear at most once within the
 * area. If a tag appears more than once, only the first instance may be
 * retrieved. If a TLV is deleted, its tag is set to a deleted
 * tag value, but the TLV continues to consume space in OTP. Currently, tags
 * are 4-bit values: \n
 *   0 --> Unused TLV \n
 *   1..10 --> System tag \n
 *   11..14 --> Application tag \n
 *   15 --> Deleted TLV
 *
 * This module is divided into several object files. This allows APIs to
 * be included or excluded as desired. For instance, one may choose to
 * include OTP_TLV write in manufacturing firmware but not in Mission
 * Mode firmware.
