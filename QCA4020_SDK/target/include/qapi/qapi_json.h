This section provides APIs, enumerations and data structures for applications to encode, decode, search, modify and delete JSON items.

/**
@ingroup qapi_json  
Converts a given JSON formatted string into a JSON object and returns a handle for the object.

This handle is to be used for further operations, such as query, addition, deletion, and
replacement of items.

Applications are responsible for deleting the created objects. A failure to do so causes
memory leaks. Use the API qapi_JSON_Delete_Object() for this purpose.

Information regarding JSON format can be found at www.json.org. 
This API accepts a string in JSON format as input which can be JSON object or JSON array. 
Input can also be a single value, but this case doesn't have a practical use. 
All the subcomponents of the input which are of type string must be enclosed in escaped double quotes. 
Keys in key:value pairs must be strings, however, the values can be strings, integers, floating point numbers, 
null, true or false. 
Objects/arrays can also be nested by using one object/array as the value in key:value for another object/array. 
Values in key:value pairs which are of type string must be enclosed in escaped double quotes.
No formatting is needed for values of other types, including null, true and false.
\n
Following examples of input string demonstrate use of nested object, array and values of different types.\n
(1) {\\\"node\\\":\\\"washer\\\",\\\"soak\\\":true,\\\"time\\\":{\\\"hours\\\":1,\\\"minutes\\\":30.50}}\n
\n Note that every string in above input is enclosed in escaped double quotes.\n
(2) [\\\"value1\\\",2,3.5,true,false,null]

@param[in] input_String    JSON formatted string.
@param[in] handle          Pointer to the object handle returned to the application.

@ingroup qapi_json
This API is used to insert a new item at specified index in the specified JSON 
array. 
New item string must be JSON formatted, more information in the description for

As this API is specific for inserting entries with only value, 
not key:value, it is best used for arrays. 
Instead, the API qapi_JSON_Insert_KeyValue_By_Index() should be used for 
inserting key:value pairs. 
Note that API will not return error if used for objects however the result 
may not be as expected.
If the index is more than the length of existing object tree/array, then the 
item is appended at the end.\n
This API only works for the outermost level of nested structures. 
To insert a value in an array which is nested inside another arrays/objects, 
use qapi_JSON_Replace_Value_By_Index() instead of this API to replace the 
whole object/array which is at the outermost level.

New value string must be JSON formatted, more information

The API only works for the outermost level of nested structures.
For replacing values/objects/arrays in inner levels of nested objects, 
replace the complete array/object at the outermost level which includes 
the value to be replaced.

Example: For following object, inserting a new value in nested array or changing one value 
from the array is not possible directly as the handle provided is for the outermost object. 
Instead the whole array can be replaced with the expected value.
\n{
\n"key1": "value1",

\n}\n
