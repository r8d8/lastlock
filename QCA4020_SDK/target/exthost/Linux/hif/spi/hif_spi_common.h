 * The purpose of these blocks is to amortize SDIO command setup time
 * across multiple bytes of data. In byte mode, we must issue a command
 * for each byte. In block mode, we issue a command (8B?) for each
 * BLOCK_SIZE bytes.
 *
 * Every mailbox read/write must be padded to this block size. If the
 * value is too large, we spend more time sending padding bytes over
 * SDIO. If the value is too small we see less benefit from amortizing
 * the cost of a command across data bytes.
